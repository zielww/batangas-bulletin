                                <p>Recognizing the growing importance of mental well-being, the Department of Education (DepEd) - Batangas Division has announced an expansion of its mental wellness programs aimed at students, teachers, and non-teaching personnel in public schools across the province.</p>
                                <p><em>"A healthy mind is crucial for effective learning and teaching. We are committed to creating a supportive and nurturing environment in our schools,"</em> said the Schools Division Superintendent.</p>
                                <h3>Program Components:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Counseling Services:</strong> Increased availability of guidance counselors and psychologists.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Mental Health Literacy:</strong> Workshops and seminars for students and teachers on identifying and addressing mental health concerns.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Stress Management Workshops:</strong> Techniques and activities to help manage academic and work-related stress.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Peer Support Groups:</strong> Establishing safe spaces for students to share experiences and support one another.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The initiative will be implemented in phases, starting with high schools and gradually including elementary schools. <strong>Training for school personnel on mental health first aid is also a key component of the program.</strong></p>
                                <p>This proactive approach aims to address the mental health challenges faced by the education sector, especially in the post-pandemic era, fostering a more resilient and empathetic school community in Batangas.</p>
